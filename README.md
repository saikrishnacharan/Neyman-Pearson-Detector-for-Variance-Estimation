## Problem Statement
- There are two air crafts present in space and there is a base station present on earth. There is a condition that only one of the two air crafts will be in the region specified by the base station. If aircraft1 is present, it sends N= 1000 samples from  normally distributed distribution with mean 0 and variance \sigma_0^2 =1 and when aircraft 2 is present, it sends 1000 samples from  same distribution but with variance  \sigma_1^2 =4. It is observed  that at time t sec , 1000 samples are detected by base station. Test which air craft is present at given time. Assume Probability of False Alarm is 0.3.
